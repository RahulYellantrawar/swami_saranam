        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 30, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to <strong>Swami Saranam</strong> (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of our App.
        </p>
        <p>
            By downloading and using our App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            Our app is designed to be a simple and secure devotional guide. We collect very limited information.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Personal Information:</strong> We <strong>do not</strong> collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from you. You do not need to create an account, and we do not ask for your name, email address, phone number, or location to use the core features of the App.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Non-Personal & Technical Information:</strong> Like most mobile applications, we may automatically collect certain non-personal information to ensure the app functions correctly and to improve user experience. This includes:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the App, such as the features you use and the time spent on different sections. This helps us understand which features are most valuable to our users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Generic information about your device, such as the operating system version (e.g., Android 13) and device model. This helps us diagnose and fix bugs and compatibility issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> If the App crashes, we may collect diagnostic data to identify the cause of the problem and prevent it from happening again.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This technical data is collected in an aggregated and anonymous form and cannot be used to identify you personally.
        </p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the limited information we collect solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the App:</strong> To deliver the core functionalities and content of the app.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve the App:</strong> To analyze usage patterns and feedback to enhance features, usability, and performance.</li>
            <li><strong>To Ensure Technical Functionality:</strong> To monitor app performance, diagnose crashes, and ensure security.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            We may use third-party services like Google Play Services and Google Firebase for analytics and crash reporting. These services may collect data as described in their own privacy policies. We do not share any personal information with them because we do not collect any.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We value your trust and take reasonable measures to protect the information collected by our App. Since we do not collect any personal data, the risk to your privacy is minimal.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Our App is intended for a general audience and is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
        </p>
